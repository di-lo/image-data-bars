# image-data-bars
By using the knowledge of images and python, this program can load climate change data into a file and visualize it as data stripes.  
Climate scientists measure temperature again a "0" point which is a historical global average temperature.
Each year is measured as the "anomaly" from the historical average, so -1.5 C for a cold year or +1.5 C for a hot year.
The climate data is scaled to fit in the -1.0 .. +1.0 format, but kept the 0 point intact,
so when you see gray years, those were around the long-term average temperature, with red years above average and blue years below.
This data set is from https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2

Here is a data stripes visualization of climate change over years where red means high global warming and green is low:

Final Project Code in Place 2021. Access 2 minute video presentation .

I attended [Code in Place 2021](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) which is an intro-to-coding course based on CS106A in Stanford
teaches the fundamentals of programming using the widely-used Python language.
Image Data Bars is my final project for the course.
