This program can load climate change data into a file and visualize it as data stripes.  
Climate scientists measure temperature again a "0" point which is a historical global average temperature.
Each year is measured as the "anomaly" from the historical average, so -1.5 C for a cold year or +1.5 C for a hot year.
I scaled the climate data to fit in the -1.0 .. +1.0 format, but kept the 0 point intact,
so when you see gray years, those were around the long-term average temperature, with red years above average and blue years below.
